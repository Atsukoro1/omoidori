Virtual AI assistant through Discord

TODOs:

- [x] Virtual calendar - reminders via cronjobs
- [x] Therapist-like approach
- [x] Remember things about user (context)
- [] Function calling instead of command usage
- [] User activity awareness (only ideas)
    - [] Wakatime api
    - [] Apple healthkit (to my apple watch) - too hard probs won't do this
    - [] Discord status (if user logs on after long time - it will welcome him to spark up conversation)
- [] Program to detect desktop activity **very time consuming idea probs wont do** - also would need web server in order to work
