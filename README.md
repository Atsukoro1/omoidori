# Project OMOIDORI (思い 取り)
Virtual AI assistant through Discord

TODOs in short time:

- [x] Therapist-like approach
- [x] Remember things about user (context)
- [] Better handling of long time memories with vector DB
- [] User activity awareness (only ideas)
    - [] Wakatime api
    - [] Apple healthkit (to my apple watch) - too hard probs won't do this
    - [] Discord status (if user logs on after long time - it will welcome him to spark up conversation)
    - [] Detect what is user doing and make something with it - remember it maybe?
- [] Program to detect desktop activity **very time consuming idea probs wont do** - also would need web server in order to work
- [] Caching of some things in order to save money on prooompting :3
- [x] Vector database for message saving
- [] Rabbit MQ instead of cron set to minute to deliver perfectly timed messages
- [x] Logging to be perfectly aware of what's happening inside (in case it fails - for debugging)
- [] usage of MCP instead of classic tooling? :3

TODOs in the long run: 
- I want to make something like Neuro sama with face and voice features but I lack hardware and will be very expensive to do it 
in cloud so the features are here: 

- [] Voice recognition (maybe mood recognition and responding in the same matter)
- [x] Voice responses
- [x] Some model that will move as it will speak, at least to look like it's something speaking with you (this will make it to not be Discord bot anymore lol but nevermind) Is done partially, it does respond to emotions but does not have any additional body movement 

VIBE CODING AT IT'S FINEST
This project is made with DeepSeek, just had a quick *ADHD moment* idea and really had to make it reality :D
please don't look into the code, I'm retarded
-- Edit - It's not quick ADHD idea anymore, I'm working on it for more than 2 weeks xd and without AI rn and I think the code is pretty decent - yay
-- Edit (4/19/2025) It surprised me that it's a pretty decent project right now :O Just waiting for the hardware and I will make it run locally :D

## How it works right now
This is primarily for me to later see this and remember how it works

### Communication between Unity frontend and the AI engine

### AI processing of the messages

### Unity displaying the messages in action
